This example lists all Text Files in a folder with extension (.txt).
Just copy the *.py file and output.txt in the folder you want to list all the files and just double clink in .py file.

To change the extension is very simple just change the "txt" names in the code to png/jpg/mp4 or anything else for your needs.
